# Cmod_Spartan7_25_FPGA_Board
A small 4 layers Spartan7 FPGA dev board, inspired by Digilent Cmod 

  
Pin compatible with ESP32-like board. Plus a PMOD interface. All IO are differential route out. And Bank15 IO voltage are selectable (3.3 or 1.8) using 0 ohm resistor jumper. 

  
4Gbit DDR3 memory running at 800MT/s error free (didn't even length match, it just works at such short chip to chip distance) 

  
128Mbit boot flash. 

  
Well protected power distribute system and high speed ESD on all IO port.


Made with LCEDA.
